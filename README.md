This repository contains the code required to produce a JLF color coded visualization for ITK snap.

Example code for how to produce the color table can be found in the scripts/exampleScripts/ directory.
In there exists two scripts, the first R code (produceExampleColorTable.R) shows you how to produce a dummy color table and associated key. 
The second bash script shows you how to create the associated color coded image necassary to visualize the effect sizes in itk snap. 
Finally the bash code also gives an example for how to open the image, and associated color table.

Questions should be sent to Adon Rosen (adon.rosen@gmail.com)
